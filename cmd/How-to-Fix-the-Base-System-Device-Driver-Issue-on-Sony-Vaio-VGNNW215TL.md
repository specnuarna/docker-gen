In this article, we will show you how to fix the base system device driver issue on your Sony Vaio VGN-NW215TL laptop. There are two methods you can try: manually downloading and installing the driver from the manufacturer's website, or using a third-party driver updater tool.
 
## Method 1: Manually Download and Install the Driver from Sony's Website
 
This method requires you to identify the hardware ID of the base system device and find the corresponding driver on Sony's website. Here are the steps:
 
1. Open Device Manager by pressing Windows + X keys and selecting Device Manager from the menu.
2. Expand Other devices and right-click on Base System Device. Select Properties.
3. Go to Details tab and select Hardware Ids from the drop-down menu. You will see a list of values starting with PCI\VEN\_...
4. Copy the first value and paste it into a web browser. You can use a website like [PCIDatabase.com](https://www.pcidatabase.com/) to identify the device name and manufacturer.
5. For example, if your hardware ID is PCI\VEN\_1180&DEV\_0592&SUBSYS\_906B104D&REV\_12, you will find out that your device is a Ricoh Memory Stick Controller made by Ricoh Co Ltd.
6. Go to Sony's website and search for your laptop model (VGN-NW215TL). Go to Drivers and Software section and select your operating system (Windows 10).
7. Look for the driver that matches your device name and manufacturer. For example, if your device is a Ricoh Memory Stick Controller, look for a driver named Ricoh PCIe Memory Stick Host Controller or something similar.
8. Download and install the driver following the instructions on the screen. Restart your laptop and check if the base system device issue is resolved.

## Method 2: Use a Third-Party Driver Updater Tool
 
This method is easier and faster than the first one, as it does not require you to manually identify and download the driver. A third-party driver updater tool can scan your laptop for missing or outdated drivers and automatically download and install them for you. Here are some steps:

1. Download and install a reliable driver updater tool, such as [Driver Easy](https://www.drivereasy.com/), [Driver Booster](https://www.iobit.com/en/driver-booster.php), or [Auslogics Driver Updater](https://www.auslogics.com/en/software/driver-updater/).
2. Launch the tool and click on Scan Now or Start Scan button. The tool will scan your laptop for any driver issues.
3. Once the scan is complete, you will see a list of drivers that need to be updated or installed. Look for the base system device driver and click on Update or Install button next to it.
4. The tool will download and install the driver for you. Restart your laptop and check if the base system device issue is resolved.

### Conclusion
 
The base system device driver issue on Sony Vaio VGN-NW215TL laptop can be fixed by either manually downloading and installing the driver from Sony's website or using a third-party driver updater tool.
